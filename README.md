# Rhythm Game
Name coming soon!

This rhythm game is a 49-key mania-style rhythm game with millisecond-level judgement and MIDI beatmaps.

## How to Play
Using the keys on your keyboard, press the correct key when the bottom line on the note overlaps with the judgement line, and release that key when the top line on the note overlaps with the judgement line.

## Development
To develop or test-play this game:
1. Clone this repository with `git clone https://github.com/Pickelgold/rhythm-game.git`
2. Download and install Godot 4 and import the directory
3. Open the game in Godot and press the play button

## Contributing
At this time, I am not looking for active developers. However, if you would like to contribute in other ways or have found a bug/performance improvement, you may submit an issue or pull request.

## TODO
* Implement accuracy, combo, and performance points
* Implement average note density as a proxy for difficulty
* Create a beatmap picker
* Implement freeplay transcription
* Implement ranked and unranked mods
* Create a server to share scores, profiles, and beatmaps
* Reduce stutters, increase framerate
* Custom keyboard profiles
* Custom colors and a better-looking skin
* Beta testing
